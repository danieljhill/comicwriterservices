## Original Repo - Read Me Notes

[Comic Writer Services](http://comicwriterservices.com/) is a resource for aspiring and experienced comic book writers. 

The aim of the website was to improve on, and update, a similar resource that [Caleb Monroe](http://calebmonroe.com/blog/) had compiled many years ago for aspiring comic book writers. 

The idea is to list every notable article and resource on the art and craft of comic book writing. 

I thought it might be a neat idea to put the entire text file up on GitHub so:

- People can nab the raw text if they want to. 
- The file and resource will be backed up somewhere for posterity and safe-keeping. 
- Like-minded people can suggest additions to the list that can be incorporated back into the site. 
- People can fork the information off and find their own uses for it. 

Have at it!
